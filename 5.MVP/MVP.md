# MVP

Our MVP will include a system where we can:
* add classes (adding the scheduled lecture, and tutorial)
* add deadlines for assignments

We are building a Time Management System for Students to assist with their university experience.  Students will sign up for classes they are enrolled in, once subscribed students will be able to view all upcoming due dates and test dates.  Dates will be validated by the culumative effort of students in the class.  Hence the professor will not be obligated to participate.  

  Within our MVP we will implement basic features such as creating users (students and instructors) and adding courses.  Students will also be able to remove courses from their calendar, just incase they drop the course.
The user interface of our Time Management System will be presented on a console. Students will be able to log into the system and view a calendar consisting of the events for all of their current courses. They will be able to view all important upcoming events which will  allow them to better manage their time. Students will also be able to add assignments for the classes they are enrolled in.  

  Our Time Management System will differ from other similar systems because ours will include the following features:  Assignments and Tests will keep track of their own weight, which will allow students to be able to better delegate the time they spend studying. The appearance of events will differ depending on their type and weight.  Students will also be emailed a notification when a new event is created or when the time of an event has changed.  
  
  As a team we will strive to make the interface as user friendly as possible.  We do not want our users to have to dedicate much time to get comfortable with our system. In the end, we believe that our System will help increase the grades of all students that use it.
