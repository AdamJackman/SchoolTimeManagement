I'm Adam, 4th year Computer Science specialist. 
I am most proficient in Java, having programmed the majority of my projects using this language.
In general I am most interested in algorithm creation, security, and database programming. 
However, given the diverse courses we have been required to take at UTM; I am also experienced in most major languages and computer science topics, therefore, I am comfortable in pretty much any role.
