##Which option did you choose? 
   
The project option that our group came to a decision to was the Time Management Tool for Students. 
##Why did you choose it?
   
We chose this option because our group felt most comfortable in making this project as a console-based application as well as we felt we could incorporate more cool features in this option. When we were deciding which option to do we listed out the features that we could think of to make our group stand out and we feel that the Time Management Tool afforded more flexibility in design.

##How did you reach the decision as a group?
    
To reach this decision our group was involved in a continuous discussion about how we would implement each option and how comfortable each team member felt with that approach. We considered things like web-design, python vs. java, and advanced features of each option. When it came down to deciding these decisions we voted among all group members and the majority felt that option 2 was the best. The others that didnâ€™t vote for option 2 were quick to leave their feelings behind and we are all happy moving forward with option 2.
